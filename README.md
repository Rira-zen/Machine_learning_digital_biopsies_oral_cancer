# Machine_learning_digital_biopsies_oral_cancer

The complete code, data processing scripts, and experiment configurations used in my doctoral thesis as a part of the completion of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Oral Medicine at the University of Melbourne are available in the current GitHub repository.

I created a conda environment called ConnieTorch to specifically implement this code.

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
Created a new virtual environment called ConnieTorch
conda create -n ConnieTorch python=3.11
to activate this environment
conda activate connie_pytorch
